## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[React Native](https://vitejs.dev/) description here.

[Expo](https://reactjs.org/) description here.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a cross-platform app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the Expo docs for [programming with React Native and Expo](https://docs.expo.dev) and the React Native docs for [using components to make your appss](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).

### Notes about Expo
- This template has already 1. Installed `expo-cli`, and 2. Initialized this project. If you follow the guides in the Expo docs, be sure to *skip over* those two steps.
- The next step is to either register for or login to Expo using the following commands in the Shell...
	- To register: `expo register`
  - To login: `expo login`
- To get help with expo-cli, use `expo -h` or `expo --help` in the Shell.

### Typescript

Just rename any file from `.jsx` to `.tsx`. You can also try our [TypeScript Template](https://replit.com/@replit/React-TypeScript)
